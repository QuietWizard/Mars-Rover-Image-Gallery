# Mars Rover Image Gallery
An app that dynamically pulls images based on a selected camera from the NASA Mars Rover archives.  The app has an infinite scroll component, when there are enough images.

This application requires NodeJS to run, get it at: https://nodejs.org/en/

After installing NodeJS, go to the root of the application and run "npm install" from a terminal or command prompt.  This will install all the dependencies associated with this application.

Once the installation is completed type "npm start" to start the built in web server.  Once the web server is running, open a browser and go to the url "localhost:3000".  This will start the application.

In the dropdown, choose a camera to dynamically pull Nasa Images from the Mars Rover archive.

Enjoy!
